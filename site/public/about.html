				<h7>ABOUT</h7>
				<p>Hunted Hero Comics is a publication based in Hunter College of New York, NY. We're dedicated to giving the Hunter community an outlet for their visual stories and to create for them a great opportunity to have their work published and tangible. View our <a href = "guidelines.html">submission guidelines</a> for more info.</p>
				<p>We're always looking for more writers, artists, designers, inkers, letterers, colorists, and comic fans! Whether you want to get knee-deep in every issue or just observe and love us from afar, we welcome you. Even if you don't feel if you have the skills to write or draw your own comic, there are workshops Hunted Hero Comics hosts that will help you on your way. Show us your work, write articles for us, or just show up for the good company and friends. Check the <a href="calendar.html">calendar</a> for more information on upcoming events.
