				<h7>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</h7>
				<p>1. Dimensions: 6.875" x 10.5" at 300 DPI. 
Your submitted images must be in this size if you are doing a regular full-page comic. Keep in mind that the pages will be trimmed down, and anything in the outer inch is at risk of being cut off. Very important, if you want something in your image to not be cut off, KEEP IT AN INCH FROM THE EDGE. This means ALL TEXT.
</p><p>
2. Formats: PDF, PNG, or TIFF.
If you submit a JPG or any other lossy format, keep it above 600DPI, and compression to a minimum. If you don't know what that means, then submit in one of the formats above.
</p><p>
3. You must create or already have a dropbox account to submit.
Contact <a href="mailto:huntedherocomics@gmail.com?Subject=My%20Submission" target="_top">
huntedherocomics@gmail.com</a> for details when you are ready. You can upload only a portion of your comic if not all of it is finished yet. If you hate dropbox and don't have or want an account, then I'm sorry, you'll have to give in to the man and/or system.
</p><p>
NOTES: Your comic does not have to completely fill the page. You may leave a border around it if you wish. If you do fill the page, it will be borderless to the edge of the paper, with 1/8th inch cut off. This is entirely up to you. Your submitted files though, must always be in the above spec.
</p><p>
If you need help, a scanner, or if anything is unclear, please ask.</p>

				<p>We hope to see you soon!</p>
